# CSC 6240: Final Project â€“ Survey on PCA and Machine Learning Theory

This repository contains my final project for **CSC 6240: Mathematics and Theory of Machine Learning** at Tennessee Tech. The project focuses on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), supported by both a written survey and practical implementation.

##  Repository Contents

- **CSC 6240 Final Project Code** â€“ Jupyter notebooks and scripts implementing PCA techniques.
- **CSC 6240 Final Project References** â€“ Sources and citations used in the survey and final presentation.
- **CSC 6240 In-Class Presentation** â€“ Slides used for in-class delivery of the project.
- **A_Survey_of_Principal_Component_Analysis_and_Applications.pdf** â€“ Written survey paper (unpublished).
- **CSC 6240 PCA Code.ipynb** â€“ Core implementation of PCA in Python.
- **CSC_6240_Final_Presentation.pdf** â€“ Final presentation slides summarizing the project and findings.

##  Summary

This project explores **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** from both a theoretical and applied lens. It includes a full literature survey (unpublished), a practical implementation using Python, and presentations summarizing key findings and applications.
